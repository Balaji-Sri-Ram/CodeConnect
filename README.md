Coding Practice Platform using MERN Stack – CodeConnect
Learning Data Structures & Algorithms often becomes difficult without a structured platform, real problems, and hands-on practice.
To solve this, I built CodeConnect, a full-stack MERN application that helps users practice coding problems and prepare for technical interviews in a focused and interactive way.

🧠 What the platform does:
 ✅ Provides a structured list of coding problems
 ✅ Categorizes problems by difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
 ✅ Displays detailed problem statements with input & output formats
 ✅ Allows users to write code directly in the browser
 ✅ Supports multiple programming languages
 ✅ Executes and evaluates code submissions
 ✅ Maintains a clean and distraction-free coding interface
 ✅ Implements secure user authentication

Instead of jumping between resources, CodeConnect brings problem-solving, coding, and learning into one platform, closely simulating real interview practice and competitive coding environments.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
 • Full-stack MERN architecture
 • React state management & component design
 • REST API development using Node & Express
 • MongoDB schema design
 • Authentication using JWT
 • Building real-world developer tools from scratch
